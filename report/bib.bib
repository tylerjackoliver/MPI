abstract = {The fundamental electrical limits of MOSFETs are discussed and modeled to predict the scaling limits of digital bulk CMOS circuits. Limits discussed include subthreshold currents, time depen-dent dielectric breakdown TDDB, hot electron eeects, and drain induced barrier lowering DIBL. This paper predicts the scaling of bulk CMOS MOSFETs to reach its limits at drawn dimensions of approximately 0:1m. These electrical limits are used to scaling factors for SPICE Level 3 model parameters, and a scalable Level 3 device model is presented. Current trends in scaling interconnects are also discussed.},

@article{Perez2016,
abstract = {Using generic interpolation machinery based on solving Poisson equations, a variety of novel tools are introduced for seamless editing of image regions. The rst set of tools permits the seamless importation of both opaque and transparent source image regions into a destination region. The second set is based on similar mathematical ideas and allows the user to modify the appearance of the image seamlessly, within a selected region. These changes can be arranged to affect the texture, the illumination, and the color of objects lying in the region, or to make tileable a rectangular selection.},
