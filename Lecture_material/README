A few useful files for the MPI course.

The file "cirrusmpi.pbs" should be used for submitting MPI jobs to the
backend of Cirrus using the Portable Batch System PBS. Instructions
are included as comments in the file itself.

The file "archermpi.pbs" should be used for submitting MPI jobs to the
backend of ARCHER using the Portable Batch System PBS. Instructions
are included as comments in the file itself.

The Makefiles should be easier to use than compiling by hand.
